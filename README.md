Availability Evaluation of Industrial Internet of Things under Malware Propagation: 
An Extended Reliability Block Diagram Approach Based on Stochastic Games

# Introduction
Source code for the paper entitled "Availability Evaluation of Industrial Internet of Things under Malware Propagation: 
An Extended Reliability Block Diagram Approach Based on Stochastic Games" submitted to IEEE Transactions on Reliability for possible publication.



# Installation for game simulation
```
pip install gym-idsgame==1.0.12
```

# Usage
EDQL, DQN, AC, and Reinforce are four different RL algorithms which solve the stochastic games.

Availability evaluation experiments for three types of IIoT networks are conducted using MATLAB.
